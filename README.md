## Command-line Arguments

## Why?

While importing pictures scanned with the [Epson FastFoto FF-640](https://amazon.com/dp/B01HR89FNK) to Google Photos, I noticed that the DateTaken EXIF metadata was defaulted to a time of 00:00, but that the Date was correct.  When uploaded to Google Photos, it thought that the Time Zone was Central, which meant that all of the photos were showing a taken date of the previous day.  Windows doesn't seem to let you modify the **time** of the DateTaken value, so this was my quick solution.
